   >This page was inspired by a tweet from Salma . Pretty HTML only pages are difficult to make well, and accessible. But here we are. I'm trying my best.
   Learning HTML can be a rewarding and empowering experience. It opens up a world of possibilities for creating and contributing to the ever-expanding digital landscape. <br> Whether you're a curious beginner or an aspiring web developer, HTML is a valuable skill to have in your toolbox.

<br>If you're interested in learning more about HTML, there are plenty of resources available online and in libraries. <br>You can find interactive tutorials, video courses, and even books that can guide you through the process step-by-step.

So, why not dive into the world of HTML and start building your own corner of the web? Remember, the possibilities are endless! <br>
I hope this gives you a good overview of HTML. If you have any specific questions or want to delve deeper into any aspect, feel free to ask! <br> If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? If time flies when you're having fun, does it walk when you're bored? If you can't see the forest for the trees, can you see the trees for the forest? Why is a carrot more orange than an orange? Why is the sky blue but the grass green?
